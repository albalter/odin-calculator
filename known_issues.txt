while there is an equalaity operator being pressed
with an equality operator already on the stack
it forms an expression similar to x = x =, which
can be seen as a bug

signifier inputs are happening in the reverse order -- RESOLVED

8/14/25 ~2:40 multiple bugs with division and a certain bug with 
nultiplication (need to reproduce to describe). seems to be 
getting a "dirty value" for it's arithmethical input. Ok, 
pivoting to debug the division.

8/14/25 the order of evaluation in the division function in the backend
of the program was backwards, meaning a whole lot of bugs resulted. -- RESOLVED

8/14/25 pressing "zero" and then operation never yields proper
results, not for any opeartion, except maybe addition -- that's 
why it was overlooked. looking into this now. -- RESOLVED

8/14/25 while inputing a line of ops "8 * 9 /" we get 0.888888, which
is wrond since we would normally want to get product of 8 and 9, posssibly 
followed by the division op, but not this. pivoting to this issue
