while there is an equalaity operator being pressed
with an equality operator already on the stack
it forms an expression similar to x = x =, which
can be seen as a bug

signifier inputs are happening in the reverse order -- RESOLVED

8/14/25 ~2:40 multiple bugs with division and a certain bug with 
nultiplication (need to reproduce to describe). seems to be 
getting a "dirty value" for it's arithmethical input. Ok, 
pivoting to debug the division.

8/14/25 the order of evaluation in the division function in the backend
of the program was backwards, meaning a whole lot of bugs resulted. -- RESOLVED

8/14/25 pressing "zero" and then operation never yields proper
results, not for any opeartion, except maybe addition -- that's 
why it was overlooked. looking into this now. -- RESOLVED

8/14/25 while inputing a line of ops "8 * 9 /" we get 0.888888, which
is wrond since we would normally want to get product of 8 and 9, posssibly 
followed by the division op, but not this. pivoting to this issue -- RESOLVED

7/0 bugs the calculator to not do any operation and the stack trace
display gets stuck. pivoting to the issue. 

-- It's just the zero division error being logged to the console silently. 
-- Need to handle cleanup, because after trying 7/0= and getting an exception
putting in 6 garners the same exception (should just 7/6) -- RESOLVED

8/14/2025 4:12 -- inputs like 03333 are possible, but not always (some
guards are inb place). Working to narrow down what makes this possible
update inputs like 459 + 0333 are possible, looking to resolve the issue.
strings like 00333 are not being formed.

-- I narrowed the condition to only work with "fresh" values, not
appended values, but now on the condition of 83 * 0 we can't input the zero,
so it's still bugged. Needs more work. -- 5:18 RESOLVED

-- 5:20 Equality sign doesn't always do it's thing, trying to 
narrow down further.
